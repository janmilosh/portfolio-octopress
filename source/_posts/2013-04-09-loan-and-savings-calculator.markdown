Here's a little JavaScript project that I just completed. It's a single page site that provides a calculator for comparing either loan or savings scenarios. Data can be entered in three different ways in each table such that the user can calculate either the payment (or deposit), loan (or savings) term, and loan (or savings) amount. The results accumulate in a table so that comparisons can be made. [Give it a try!](http://janmilosh.com/time-value-of-money)
