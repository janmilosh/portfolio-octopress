Specially designed for use on smartphones, the [Productivity Calculator](http://janmilosh.com/productivity) was built for therapists who are trying to meet productivity targets and need a simple way to calculate either their productivity or clock-out time. Total treatment minutes for the day are input, as well as clock-in time and optional lunch-out/in times. To calculate productivity, a clock-out time must be entered and likewise to calculate the clock-out time, a productivity must be entered. Instructions are provided on a separate page.
