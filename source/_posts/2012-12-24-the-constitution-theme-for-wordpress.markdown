[![Constitution theme for WordPress](http://janmilosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/constitution-theme.jpg)](http://jan.cyberkitty.net)

[The Constitution Theme](http://jan.cyberkitty.net) was originally designed for a client's politically oriented blog. It contains two widgitized sidebars and an archive page for easy navigation to a particular blog post. The blog post date is shown in a special block to the left of the post, created entirely with CSS (instead of an image). This theme can be customized with different colors, fonts and layout tweaks.
