[![Poker Hand Comparer]({{root_url}}/images/poker-hand.png)](http://janmilosh.com/poker)

I was recently presented with a challenge to create a program that could evaluate two poker hands and declare a winner. This looked like a good opportunity to do even more, so I've come up with a JavaScript application that randomly deals two poker hands, shows the cards, and declares a winner. You can give it a try at: [janmilosh.com/poker](http://janmilosh.com/poker).
