[![Jan Milosh personal web page](http://janmilosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/jan-site.jpg)](http://jan.milosh.me)

[Jan.milosh.me](http://jan.milosh.me) is a personal website that I put together in order to try out a few new features. I used a full-page background image for this single-page design. There are pop-ups for a contact form and a map. This eliminates the need for multiple pages. Although I love WordPress, for sites like this, a simpler approach is more appropriate.

This site was designed to work on any size device and a smaller image is delivered to phones and small tablets.
