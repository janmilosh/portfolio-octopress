[![Cat themed website](http://janmilosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ollie-site.jpg)](http://ollie.cyberkitty.net)

[Ollie.cyberkitty.net](http://ollie.cyberkitty.net) is another of my practice websites. Sorry, but a cat theme won out again. I wanted to try out a few features and needed a particularly handsome subject for the site.

This is a single page site with menu links at the top-left of each section. It features a large circular image of Ollie. Smooth-scroll jQuery navigation is used for an improved user experience. (When you click on a menu link, the page will scroll to the section, rather than jumping instantly.) The CSS3 transition property is used for the menu hover element. It was a quick, fun site to put together. I've used the same wood-grain background for one of the color schemes on this site.
