[![Useful Links Webpage](http://janmilosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/links.jpg)](http://links.cyberkitty.net)

I created [links.cyberkitty.net](http://links.cyberkitty.net) so that I would have easy access to some of the many websites that I often visit. This is a single-page site, and consists of four columns of buttons that link to various sites useful for web design. There are two color schemes to choose from (light and dark)--see the two buttons at the lower right corner. This has been a useful site to have when I want to quickly find one of my favorite resources.
