[Round House Project](http://milosh.me/house) is a photo blog (journal) of our home construction project. This is another custom WordPress website. One special feature is the option to change themes (color schemes) via a selector in the right header. There are five themes to choose from.

The site also has two sidebars and a complete archives page. The blog page shows post titles and a Featured Image for each post. Clicking on either the image or title will take you to that particular entry. An index of entries is included at the bottom of each single post page. This enables the removal of the sidebars from pages containing the full-size images and provides a less cluttered appearance.
