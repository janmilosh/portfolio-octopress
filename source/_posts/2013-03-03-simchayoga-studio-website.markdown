[![SimchaYoga](http://janmilosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/simchayoga-site.jpg)](http://simchayoga.com)

[SimchaYoga.com](http://simchayoga.com) is a completely custom website created for a yoga studio in Beverly Hills, California. It features a full-page background image (of the view from the studio windows) and a transparent content background that scrolls over the image. The site includes a blog and the latest post appears on the front page.

The testimonials page contains block-quote formatting to bring out the individual testimonial content. The site also includes a comment form and archive page which presents an index of the blog posts.
