[![Take-Five Color Palette Application]({{root_url}}/images/color-palette.png)](http://janmilosh.com/color-palette)

The idea for my [Take-Five Color Palette Creator](http://janmilosh.com/color-palette) came from the desire to create a color picking tool that I can really use on projects.

With the ability to choose (and keep) five colors on the screen at once, this application has practical value for anyone trying to come up with a color palette. If the user doesn't care for a chosen color or wants fewer colors appearing, the clear button on each block brings the color back to black.

I built this with my own workflow in mind and will use it for inspiration in my own designs. It will be much easier and quicker than my old method of creating blocks of color in my vector drawing program. Hopefully others will also find it useful.
