With the plan to eventually incorporate a random color generator into one of my personal blogs, I decided to create a simple random color palette application. This application is also useful for inspiration. Instead of coming up with a single random color, it creates a whole palette randomly. See it here: [janmilosh.com/random-palette](http://janmilosh.com/random-palette/). For this app. I put some constraints on the color ranges to increase the possibility of the colors working well together. There are many types of color palettes, and this represents just one possibility.

Here's an iframe of the app:
