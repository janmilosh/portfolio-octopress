[The iPad Chronicles](http://janmilosh.com/ipad) was created just for fun. I wanted a blog that had no particular purpose, but where I could record daily life as seen through my iPad. My plan is to post images and videos, and to post daily.

The site is a straightforward WordPress blog based on my custom theme. I decided to create a colorful background based on layers of blue and green rectangles, then decided to add a theme changing option in the sidebar, so there will be alternate color schemes to choose from.
