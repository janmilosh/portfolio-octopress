[![Websites for Engineers](http://janmilosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/engineering-site.jpg)](http://engineeringwebsites.milosh.me)
[Websites for Engineers](http://engineeringwebsites.milosh.me) is a custom-designed WordPress site.Â It's mobile-friendly (adjusts to fit tablets and smartphones) and was created for the purpose of marketing web development services to Engineers. It's a basic static-page only site (i.e. no blog content) and includes a small slideshow of site screenshot images. The slideshow was developed with the [Soliloquy Slideshow](http://soliloquywp.com/) plugin.
