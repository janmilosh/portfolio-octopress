[![Coating Line Animation]({{root_url}}/images/simulation-2.png)](http://janmilosh.com/simulation-2)

The first version of this simulation (shown in the [previous post](http://janmilosh.com/coating-line-simulation-using-d3-javascript-library/)) was created to help visualize the flow of items as they underwent a coating and curing process. This version is simply a revision with a more streamlined layout and different patterning for the items' movements. It is an animation, created with [D3.js](http://d3.js), a JavaScript library for data visualization. You can see this version [here](http://janmilosh.com/simulation-2)Â (note: This animation works best on Google Chrome, and requires a modern browser--not IE8). This revised animation will be used in the continuing analysis during the engineering/development phase of building the production line.
