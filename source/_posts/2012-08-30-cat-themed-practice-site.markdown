[Cats.cyberkitty.net](http://cats.cyberkitty.net) was an early single-page practice website that I built. It's quite simple but was a good learning experience. I chose to duplicate the layout of a site that was created for a European band. It began with a slideshow, had a video embed, and had Sound Cloud music embeds. It also incorporated a JavaScript show/hide function beneath the slideshow.

I managed to incorporate all of the elements of the original site. This was also my introduction to creating mobile-friendly websites using the Foundation by Zurb grid system.
